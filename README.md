# Dungeon Move Tracker

A GUI used for tracking time and movement in D&D.

I found I had accumulated several cool, but complex rules for what happens while moving about the game world, both over land and in the dungeon. 

However, even with a cheat sheet, I was always missing some steps. It's okay, I mean, the players never notice. But I always came away later thinking how much cooler it would have been if I had remembered to make some obscure roll, or wondered how long were they in that dungeon anyway. I even tried offloading the job of timekeeping to a player, and they were only about as good as I was at it.

So I made it so I just press one button each turn. Now I get reminders of where we are in the day, and when the party should be exhausted. I don't have to remember to roll for wandering monsters, or even to bluff the roll for perception anymore.
